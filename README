This sample code illustrate how to use libcistof.so to obtain image from cis tof camera.
It obtain depth and IR iamge from it, display it using opencv.



1) Preparation
==============
OpenCV and OpenGL installation at RB5
-------------------------------------
sudo apt update
sudo apt -y install cmake
sudo apt -y install build-essential
sudo apt -y install libopencv-dev
sudo apt -y install libglfw3 libglfw3-dev
sudo apt -y install freeglut3-dev

xWayland installation at RB5
----------------------------
In RB5 LU2.0 xwayland is come along with the BSP. No extra installation is needed.



2) Launch xWayland GUI at RB5
=============================
- Connect RB5 with keyboard, mouse and monitor.
- Power on RB5.
- BSP of LU2.0 be default have weston GUI being install and launch upon boot.
- A pure weston GUI with plain wallpaper will be displayed.
- It have top task bar, with one icon on left hand side, and date time info at right hand side.
- There is only one apps available in this weston GUI, i.e. "weston-terminal".
- To launch apps, "weston-terminal", click on the small icon at upper left hand corner.
- Terminal is display on RB5 Monitor.
- The xWayland still not full supported yet in LU2.0. Thus, xWayland have to be launch separately using cmd below:-
    export XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/run/user/root
    export GDK_BACKEND="x11"
    Xwayland & DISPLAY=:0 LD_LIBRARY_PATH=./build/lib/ ./build/bin/apps_used_openCV_openGL
- Refer to bash script "go_viewer_cis.sh" which launch an apps with openCV/openGL in weston GUI of LU2.0.
- A black full window (This is xWayland window, being launch separately) will be seen after comamnd "Xwayland & DISPLAY=:0". It is needed to use key sequence, win + tab, to return to the terminal and continue with the apps cui prompt.

Known limitation:-
- It is recommended to use FHD (1920x1080) monitor to prevent window cut, since openCV/openGL window decoration feature (top bar, close button, move window etc) is not support in LU2.0 yet.
- Mouse cursor is disappear on openCV window area. Temporary work-around is to move mouse cursor to area when it is visible, hold down left mouse key and move the mouse, the cursor will be visible while moving.



3) Copy hal/camx/chi-cdk libraries
==================================
Download hal/camx/chi-cdk libraries from below:-
https://github.com/OpenNuvoton/CIS-ToF-dev-drv-lib-for-Qualcomm-RB5

Then copy it into RB5 at location indicate below:-
cp com.qti.eeprom.nuvo_kw33000.so        /usr/lib/camera/
cp com.qti.sensor.kw33000.so             /usr/lib/camera/
cp com.qti.sensormodule.nuvo_kw33000.bin /usr/lib/camera/
cp camera.qcom.so          /usr/lib/hw/
cp com.qti.chi.override.so /usr/lib/hw/



4) Compile at RB5
=================
./do_viewer_cis.sh



5) Run at RB5 (Must be run at xWayland GUI prompt)
=============
./go_viewer_cis.sh
